# Sales Predictions

In this project, I will perform a sales prediction for a retailer while providing visualizations of current sales. 

For the predictions, we will be using a Linear Regression Model and Regression Tree, comparing the RMSE and R^2 of each of these models based, and recommending the best fit model.

## Features

- Visualizations
- Create Pipelines 
- Linear Regrssion Model
- Regression Tree Model




## Outcome
Based on the model's performance, I recommend the Regression Tree model over the Linear Regression Model. The RMSE was lower in the Regression Tree with a score of 1057.44 compared to 1094.76 for the linear Regression. The R^2 was higher for the Regression Tree .59 compared to .57 for the linear Regression.
